# In python you can set multiple variables on the same line:

x, y, z = 0, 0, 0

# All of the above variables are set to zero.

# Constants are variables that never change throughout the whole programs lifetime. Python does not have a way to actually define these, but programmers usually set these objects names in full caps to indicate that they never change.

CONSTANT_VAR = 0

# Comments should be written when you need to know how something works and you should describe it. Do not make too many comments, you should only make comments for stuff that needs more detail.
